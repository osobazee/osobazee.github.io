      <h2>How I Installed the Framework</h2>
      <p>I did not have to install the framework because it was hosted online. <br> This is a front-end framework so
      I didn't have to do much except sign up for an account </p>

      <h2>How I Built This Website</h2>
      <p>This website was built using Github Pages. <br>
      All I have to do was sign up and create a new repository and set the viewing to public. <br>
      So hosting the site was not complicated. Once, I made my site, I was able to start making the page.</p>

      <div>
      <h2>Difficulties</h2>
      <p>The main difficulty was the actual coding because the page would not display. <br> 
        I realized that I would have to rename the file to html to get it to work. <br> Committing change often meant that the 
        page would not load as well which made it more difficult to get it to work. <br>
        Adding the filename to the url sometimes worked to reflect the changes but not always so I don't think I will use this until 
        I know more about it
