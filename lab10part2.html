      <h2>How I Installed the Framwrk</h2>
      <p>I did not have to install the framewrok because it was hosted online. <br> Thi sis a front-end framework so
      I didn't have to do much. </p>

      <h2>How I Built This Website</h2>
      <p>This website was built using Github Pages. <br> It was very easy to implement. <br>
      All I have to do was sign up and create a new respository and set the viewing to public. 
      So hosting the site was not complicated. </p>

      <h2>Difficulties</h2>
      <p>The main difficulty was the actual coding because the page would not display. <br> 
        I realized that I would have to rename the file to html to get it to work. <br> Commiting change often meant that the 
        page would not load as well which made it more difficult to get it to work. <br>
        I fixed it by renaming the file since updating doesn't seem to work.<br>
