      <h2>How I Built This Website</h2>
      <p>This website was built using Github Pages. <br> It was very easy to implement. <br>
      All I have to do was sign up and create a new respository and set the viewing to public. 
      So hosting the site was not complicated. </p>

      <h2>Difficulties</h2>
      <p>The main difficulty was the actual coding because the page would not display. <br> 
        I realized that I would have to rename the file to html to get it to work <br>
